    - The travel
    - "3 May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna
      early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late.
      Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from
      the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very
      far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct
      time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and
      entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which
      is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.\r\n\r\nWe
      left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped
      for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken
      done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Mem., get
      recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,”
      and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along
      the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
      don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.\r\n\r\nHaving had some
      time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made
      search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had
      struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some
      importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. I find that the district
      he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three
      states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
      mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not
      able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula,
      as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance
      Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula,
      is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may
      refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.\r\n\r\nIn the population
      of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South,
      and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars
      in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter,
      who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when
      the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns
      settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered
      into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort
      of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I must
      ask the Count all about them.)"

    - Small villages
    - "I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts
      of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may
      have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had
      to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning
      I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I
      must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and
      a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant
      stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.”
      (Mem., get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started
      a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing
      to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before
      we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual
      are the trains. What ought they to be in China?\r\n\r\nAll day long we seemed
      to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes
      we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old
      missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony
      margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of
      water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
      station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire.
      Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through
      France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers;
      but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty, except when you got
      near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white
      sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of
      strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of
      course there were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
      Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats,
      great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather
      belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails. They wore high
      boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy
      black moustaches. They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing.
      On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands.
      They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.\r\n\r\nIt
      was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting
      old place. Being practically on the frontier—for the Borgo Pass leads from it
      into Bukovina—it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks
      of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible
      havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century
      it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of
      war proper being assisted by famine and disease.\r\n\r\nCount Dracula had directed
      me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be
      thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways
      of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced
      a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress—white undergarment
      with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too
      tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, “The Herr Englishman?”
      “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly
      man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately
      returned with a letter:—"

      on it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and will
      bring you to me. I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one,
      and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.\r\n\r\n“Your friend,\r\n“Dracula.”"

    - For your mother's sake!
    - "4 May.—I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count, directing
      him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on making inquiries as
      to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not understand
      my German. This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly;
      at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the
      old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way.
      He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he
      knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything
      of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they
      knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further. It was so near the time
      of starting that I had no time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious
      and not by any means comforting.\r\n\r\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady
      came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way:\r\n\r\n“Must you go? Oh!
      young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited state that she seemed to
      have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other
      language which I did not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking
      many questions. When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged
      on important business, she asked again:\r\n\r\n“Do you know what day it is?”
      I answered that it was the fourth of May. She shook her head as she said again:\r\n\r\n“Oh,
      yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” On my saying
      that I did not understand, she went on:\r\n\r\n“It is the eve of St. George’s
      Day. Do you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the
      evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know where you are going,
      and what you are going to?” She was in such evident distress that I tried to
      comfort her, but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored
      me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
      ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be
      done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise
      her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was
      imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking
      a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as
      an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure
      idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so
      well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face,
      for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and
      went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
      for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my
      neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this
      place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as
      easy in my mind as usual. If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let
      it bring my good-bye. Here comes the coach!"

    - The castle
    - "5 May. The Castle.—The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is high
      over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills I
      know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed. I am not
      sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I write till sleep
      comes. There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy
      that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly.
      I dined on what they called “robber steak”—bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned
      with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
      style of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces
      a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only
      a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWhen I got on the coach
      the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the landlady.
      They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me,
      and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door—which
      they call by a name meaning “word-bearer”—came and listened, and then looked
      at me, most of them pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer
      words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot
      dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering
      to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”—Satan, “pokol”—hell, “stregoica”—witch,
      “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”—both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak
      and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire. (Mem.,
      I must ask the Count about these superstitions)\r\n\r\nWhen we started, the
      crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size,
      all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some
      difficulty I got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not
      answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was
      a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just
      starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one seemed so
      kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched.
      I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd
      of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide
      archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in
      green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide
      linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat—“gotza” they call them—cracked
      his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
      our journey.\r\n\r\nI soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the
      beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or
      rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have
      been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping land full
      of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of
      trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere
      a bewildering mass of fruit blossom—apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove
      by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals.
      In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land”
      ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut
      out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
      hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to
      fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste
      meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo
      Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had
      not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different
      from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition
      that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not
      repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in
      foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point."

    - Down the rabbit hole!
    - "ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,
      and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her
      sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \"and what
      is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \"without pictures or conversations?\"\r\n\r\nSo
      she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made
      her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain
      would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly
      a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing so
      very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way
      to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\"
      (when[2] she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to
      have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when
      the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at
      it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her
      mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
      or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
      field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole
      under the hedge.\r\n\r\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once
      considering how in the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-hole
      went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down,
      so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before
      she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.\r\n\r\nEither
      the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time
      as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next.
      First, she[3] tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it
      was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed
      that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw
      maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves
      as she passed; it was labelled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but to her disappointment
      it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody[4]
      underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past
      it.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" thought Alice to herself. \"After such a fall as this,
      I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me
      at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
      the house!\" (Which was very likely true.)\r\n"

    - Down to the bottom...
    - "\r\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \"I wonder how many
      miles I've fallen by this time?\" she said aloud. \"I must be getting somewhere
      near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles
      down. I think—\" (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort
      in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity
      for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it
      was good practice to say it over) \"—yes, that's about the right distance—but
      then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?\" (Alice had no idea what
      Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
      say.)[5]\r\n\r\nPresently she began again. \"I wonder if I shall fall right
      through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk
      with their heads downwards! The Antipathies, I think—\" (she was rather glad
      there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word)
      \"—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please,
      Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\" (and she tried to curtsey as she
      spoke—fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could
      manage it?) \"And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me! No, it'll never
      do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nDown, down,
      down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \"Dinah'll
      miss me very much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope
      they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you
      were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might
      catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I
      wonder?\" And here Alice[6] began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to
      herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\" and
      sometimes, \"Do bats eat cats?\" for, you see, as she couldn't answer either
      question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was
      dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
      Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did
      you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap
      of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\r\n\r\nAlice was not a bit
      hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was
      all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit
      was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away
      went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned
      a corner, \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" She was close
      behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:
      she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
      from the roof."

    - Intro to Mr Hyde
    - " Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted
      by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment;
      lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and
      when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his
      eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke
      not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and
      loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when
      he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre,
      had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance
      for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits
      involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than
      to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my
      brother go to the devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently
      his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence
      in the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about
      his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\r\n\r\nNo
      doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best,
      and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature.
      It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from
      the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer’s way. His friends were those
      of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like
      ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence,
      no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,
      the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two
      could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common. It was reported
      by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing,
      looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of
      a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions,
      counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions
      of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy
      them uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way
      led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small
      and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The
      inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better
      still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop
      fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of
      smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and
      lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its
      dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,
      well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly
      caught and pleased the eye of the passenger. "

    - The cockroache
    - "One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
      transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
      and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed
      and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
      it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared
      with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\r\n\r\n\"What's
      happened to me?\" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
      although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.
      A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling
      salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of
      an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady
      fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff
      that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\r\n\r\nGregor then
      turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard
      hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. \"How about if I sleep a little
      bit longer and forget all this nonsense\", he thought, but that was something
      he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his
      present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself
      onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it
      a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering
      legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he
      had never felt before.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God\", he thought, \"what a strenuous career
      it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this
      takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that
      there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad
      and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can
      never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!\"
      He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back
      towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the
      itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which
      he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one
      of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was
      overcome by a cold shudder.\r\n\r\nHe slid back into his former position. \"Getting
      up early all the time\", he thought, \"it makes you stupid. You've got to get
      enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance,
      whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,
      these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought
      to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows,
      maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think
      about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss
      and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just
      what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business
      to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from
      up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is
      hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money together
      to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that's
      definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all
      though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five.\""

    - A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
    - " To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention
      her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole
      of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.
      All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise
      but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and
      observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed
      himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with
      a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for
      drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
      to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament
      was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his
      mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own
      high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature
      such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the
      late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\r\n\r\nI had seen little
      of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete
      happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
      finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all
      my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole
      Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old
      books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness
      of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as
      ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties
      and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing
      up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
      From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to
      Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular
      tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission
      which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family
      of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared
      with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and
      companion.\r\n\r\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning
      from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when
      my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which
      must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents
      of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again,
      and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly
      lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a
      dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly,
      with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
      knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story.
      He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot
      upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the
      chamber which had formerly been in part my own. "

    - Mr. Bennet's humor
    - " It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of
      a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\r\n\r\nHowever little known the feelings
      or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth
      is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered
      the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\r\n\r\n“My dear
      Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield
      Park is let at last?”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\r\n\r\n“But
      it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all
      about it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Do you not want to know
      who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.\r\n\r\n“You want to tell me,
      and I have no objection to hearing it.”\r\n\r\nThis was invitation enough.\r\n\r\n“Why,
      my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young
      man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday
      in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that
      he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before
      Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next
      week.”\r\n\r\n“What is his name?”\r\n\r\n“Bingley.”\r\n\r\n“Is he married or
      single?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;
      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\r\n\r\n“How
      so? How can it affect them?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife,
      “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying
      one of them.”\r\n\r\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\r\n\r\n“Design!
      Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love
      with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.”\r\n\r\n“I
      see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by
      themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as
      any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,
      you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend
      to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters,
      she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\r\n\r\n“In such cases, a
      woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear, you must
      indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“It
      is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“But consider your daughters.
      Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and
      Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you
      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible
      for us to visit him if you do not.”\r\n\r\n“You are over-scrupulous, surely.
      I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines
      by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses
      of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n“I
      desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others;
      and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured
      as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.”\r\n\r\n“They have none
      of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant
      like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.”\r\n\r\n“Mr.
      Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight
      in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”\r\n\r\n“You mistake
      me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends.
      I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at
      least.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\r\n\r\n“But I hope you will
      get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into
      the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come,
      since you will not visit them.”\r\n\r\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there
      are twenty, I will visit them all.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of
      quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of
      three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his
      character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
      little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied
      herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married;
      its solace was visiting and news. "

    - Ms Bennet's bitterness
    - " Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had
      always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that
      he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge
      of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter
      employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:\r\n\r\n“I hope Mr.
      Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n“We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley
      likes,” said her mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\r\n\r\n“But
      you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies,
      and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe Mrs.
      Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish,
      hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.”\r\n\r\n“No more have I,”
      said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving
      you.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\r\n\r\n“Don’t keep coughing so,
      Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them
      to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father;
      “she times them ill.”\r\n\r\n“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied
      Kitty fretfully. “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow fortnight.”\r\n\r\n“Aye,
      so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day
      before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not
      know him herself.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your
      friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible,
      when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”\r\n\r\n“I
      honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little.
      One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do
      not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must
      stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,
      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”\r\n\r\nThe girls stared
      at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense, nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“What can
      be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do you consider the
      forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot
      quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of
      deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”\r\n\r\nMary
      wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\r\n\r\n“While Mary is adjusting
      her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.”\r\n\r\n“I am sick
      of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear that; but why did
      not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly
      would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid
      the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of
      the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the
      rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that
      it was what she had expected all the while.\r\n\r\n“How good it was in you,
      my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you
      loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased
      I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning
      and never said a word about it till now.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Kitty, you may cough
      as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room,
      fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\r\n\r\n“What an excellent father you
      have, girls!” said she, when the door was shut. “I do not know how you will
      ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our
      time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances
      every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though
      you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
      ball.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I am the
      youngest, I’m the tallest.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing
      how soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should
      ask him to dinner. "

    - The prince and Buonaparte
    - " “Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes.
      But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to
      defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe
      he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer
      my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you
      do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”\r\n\r\nIt
      was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna PÃ¡vlovna SchÃ©rer,
      maid of honor and favorite of the Empress MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna. With these words
      she greeted Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡gin, a man of high rank and importance, who
      was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna PÃ¡vlovna had had a cough for
      some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then
      a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\r\n\r\nAll her invitations
      without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman
      that morning, ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“If you have nothing better to do, Count
      (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid
      is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and
      10—Annette SchÃ©rer.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the
      prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered,
      wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars
      on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined
      French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle,
      patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society
      and at court. He went up to Anna PÃ¡vlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her
      his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the
      sofa.\r\n\r\n“First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s
      mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and
      affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\r\n\r\n“Can
      one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if
      one has any feeling?” said Anna PÃ¡vlovna. “You are staying the whole evening,
      I hope?”\r\n\r\n“And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday.
      I must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is coming
      for me to take me there.”\r\n\r\n“I thought today’s fete had been canceled.
      I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”\r\n\r\n“If
      they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,”
      said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he
      did not even wish to be believed.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tease! Well, and what has been
      decided about NovosÃ­ltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.”\r\n\r\n“What can
      one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. “What has been
      decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe
      that we are ready to burn ours.” "

    - The golden bird
    - " A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree which
      bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about the time when
      they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one of them was gone.
      The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all
      night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve
      o’clock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing.
      Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep,
      and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep
      watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should
      come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under
      the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the
      air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at
      one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son jumped up and shot an arrow
      at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather
      from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king
      in the morning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that
      it was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One
      feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.’\r\n\r\nThen the gardener’s
      eldest son set out and thought to find the golden bird very easily; and when
      he had gone but a little way, he came to a wood, and by the side of the wood
      he saw a fox sitting; so he took his bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then
      the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me, for I will give you good counsel; I know what
      your business is, and that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach
      a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite
      to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not
      in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to
      be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can such a beast
      as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed
      it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood. Then he went
      his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and
      in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other
      looked very dirty, and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to
      that shabby house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart
      house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\r\n\r\nTime
      passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard
      of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to him. He met the
      fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the two inns, his eldest
      brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was, and called to
      him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and
      forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner. "

    - To Mrs. Saville, England.
    - " You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement
      of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived
      here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare
      and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.\r\n\r\nI am already
      far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold
      northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with
      delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from
      the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy
      climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
      and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost
      and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty
      and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just
      skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your
      leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and
      frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land
      surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the
      habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the
      phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.
      What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover
      the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial
      observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities
      consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a
      part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted
      by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer
      all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage
      with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday
      mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all
      these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which
      I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage
      near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
      requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible,
      can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\r\n\r\nThese reflections
      have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart
      glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes
      so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul
      may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of
      my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages
      which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean
      through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of
      all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good
      Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond
      of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with
      them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my
      father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a
      seafaring life.\r\n\r\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time,
      those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also
      became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined
      that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and
      Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how
      heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune
      of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier
      bent.\r\n\r\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.
      I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great
      enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers
      on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine,
      thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during
      the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine,
      and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive
      the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate
      in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt
      a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and
      entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider
      my services. "

    - The welcome in the dark
    - "5 May.—I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I must
      have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In the gloom the courtyard
      looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great
      round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is. I have not yet been
      able to see it by daylight.\r\n\r\nWhen the calèche stopped, the driver jumped
      down and held out his hand to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice
      his prodigious strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could
      have crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed them
      on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with
      large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. I could
      see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the
      carving had been much worn by time and weather. As I stood, the driver jumped
      again into his seat and shook the reins; the horses started forward, and trap
      and all disappeared down one of the dark openings.\r\n\r\nI stood in silence
      where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell or knocker there was no
      sign; through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely
      that my voice could penetrate. The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt
      doubts and fears crowding upon me. What sort of place had I come to, and among
      what kind of people? What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?
      Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to
      explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s clerk! Mina
      would not like that. Solicitor—for just before leaving London I got word that
      my examination was successful; and I am now a full-blown solicitor! I began
      to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake. It all seemed like a
      horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find
      myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now
      and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered
      the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake and
      among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the
      coming of the morning."

    - Dinner is served
    - "The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I fell
      to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese and a salad
      and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my supper. During
      the time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions as to my journey,
      and I told him by degrees all I had experienced.\r\n\r\nBy this time I had finished
      my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun
      to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at the same time excusing himself that
      he did not smoke. I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of
      a very marked physiognomy.\r\n\r\nHis face was a strong—a very strong—aquiline,
      with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty
      domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere.
      His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
      hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could
      see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly
      sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness
      showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the rest, his ears were
      pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and
      the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor."

    - Tomes and red ink
    - "In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books,
      whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers. A
      table in the centre was littered with English magazines and newspapers, though
      none of them were of very recent date. The books were of the most varied kind—history,
      geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law—all relating to
      England and English life and customs and manners. There were even such books
      of reference as the London Directory, the “Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s
      Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and—it somehow gladdened my heart to see it—the
      Law List.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the
      Count entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good
      night’s rest. Then he went on:—\r\n\r\n“I am glad you found your way in here,
      for I am sure there is much that will interest you. These companions”—and he
      laid his hand on some of the books—“have been good friends to me, and for some
      years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many,
      many hours of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England;
      and to know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of
      your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to
      share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is. But
      alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books. To you, my friend, I look
      that I know it to speak.”\r\n\r\n“But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English
      thoroughly!” He bowed gravely."

    - The count reveals his nature
    - "When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could not find
      the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have
      not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very peculiar man! After breakfast
      I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found
      a room looking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I
      stood there was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge
      of a terrible precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand
      feet without touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green
      tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and there
      are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests.\r\n\r\nBut
      I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I explored
      further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted. In no place
      save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit.\r\n\r\nThe
      castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!"
